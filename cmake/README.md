# Build system description

The project uses CMake build configuration.

The following controls are available during the configure stage:
```
TBB_TEST:BOOL - Enable testing (ON by default)
TBB_STRICT:BOOL - Treat compiler warnings as errors (ON by default)
TBB_NUMA_SUPPORT:BOOL - Enable TBBBind build target and task_arena extensions for NUMA support (depends on Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) library) (OFF by default)
TBB_SANITIZE:STRING - Sanitizer parameter, passed to compiler/linker
TBB_SIGNTOOL:FILEPATH - Tool for digital signing, used in post install step for libraries if provided.
TBB_SIGNTOOL_ARGS:STRING - Additional arguments for TBB_SIGNTOOL, used if TBB_SIGNTOOL is set.
TBB4PY_BUILD:BOOL - Enable  Intel(R) oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) Python module build (OFF by default)
TBB_CPF:BOOL - Enable preview features of the library (OFF by default)
TBB_INSTALL_VARS:BOOL - Enable auto-generated vars installation(packages generated by `cpack` and `make install` will also include the vars script)(OFF by default)
```

# Getting Started

## Configure, build and test

### Prerequisites

*  CMake >= 3.1

### Preparation

In order to perform out-of-source build you have to create a build directory somewhere and go there:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/my-build
cd /tmp/my-build
```

### Configure

```bash
cmake <options> <repo_root>
```

Some useful options:
- `-G <generator>` - specify particular project generator, see `cmake --help` for details.
- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` - specify for Debug build, it doesn't applicable for multi-config generators, e.g. for Visual Studio generator).

### Build

```bash
cmake --build <options> .
```

Some useful options:
- `--target <target>` - specific target, "all" is default.
- `--config <Release|Debug>` - build configuration, applicable only for multi-config generators, e.g. Visual Studio generator.

Binaries are placed to `./<compiler-id>_<compiler-ver>_cxx<stdver>_<build-type>` (for example, `./gnu_4.8_cxx11_release`)

#### Build for 32-bit

* Intel Compiler: just source Intel(R) C++ Compiler with `ia32` and build as usual.
* MSVC: use switch for [generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html) (e.g. `-A Win32` for [VS2019](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Visual%20Studio%2016%202019.html)) during the configuration stage and then build as usual.
* GCC/Clang: specify `-m32` during the configuration: `CXXFLAGS=-m32 cmake ..` or `cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-m32 ..`
* Any other compiler which builds for 64-bit by default: specify 32-bit compiler key during the configuration as above.

#### Windows specific builds (CMake 3.15 or newer is required)

* Dynamic linkage with CRT: default behavior, can be explicitly specified by setting `CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` to `MultiThreadedDLL` or `MultiThreadedDebugDLL`.
```bash
cmake ..  # dynamic linkage is used by default
```
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreadedDLL ..
```
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreadedDebugDLL -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```
* Static linkage with CRT: set `CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` to `MultiThreaded` or `MultiThreadedDebug`.
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreaded ..
```
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreadedDebug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```
* Windows 10 Universal Windows application build: set `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` to `WindowsStore` and `CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION` to `10.0`.

_Note: set `TBB_NO_APPCONTAINER` to `ON` in order to apply `/APPCONTAINER:NO` option during the compilation (used for testing)._
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME:STRING=WindowsStore -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION:STRING=10.0 ..
```
* Universal Windows Driver build: set `TBB_WINDOWS_DRIVER` to `ON` and use static linkage with CRT (see above).

```bash
cmake -DTBB_WINDOWS_DRIVER=ON -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreaded ..
```

### Test

#### Build test
Using default ('all') target:
```
cmake --build .
```

or using specific test target:
```
cmake --build . --target <test> # e.g. test_version
```

#### Run test

Using CTest:
```bash
ctest
```

or using 'test' target:
```bash
cmake --build . --target test # currently doesn't work on Windows
```

## Sanitizers - —Åonfigure, build and run

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DTBB_SANITIZE=thread ..  # or -DTBB_SANITIZE=memory or any other sanitizer
make -j
ctest -V
```

## Test specification (Doxygen)

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DTBB_TEST_SPEC=ON ..
make test_spec
```

## Intallation and packaging

**NOTE: be careful about installation: avoid commands like `make install` unless you fully understand the consequences.**

Simple packaging using CPack is supported.
The following commands allow to create a simple portable package which includes header files, libraries and integration files for CMake:

```bash
cmake <options> ..
cpack
```

## oneTBB Python Module support
`TBB4PY_BUILD` Cmake option provides ability to build Python module for oneTBB.

### Targets:
 - `irml` - build IPC RML server
 - `python_build` - build oneTBB module for Python

`python_build` target requirements:
 - Python version 3.5 or newer
 - SWIG version 3.0.6 or newer

## CMake files

### Compile/link options

Compile and link options may be specific for certain compilers. This part is handled in `cmake/compilers/*` files.

Options in TBB CMake are handled via variables in two ways for convenience:

*  by options group
*  by specific option

#### Options group

Naming convention is the following: `TBB_<SCOPE>_<STAGE>_<CATEGORY>`, where

*  `<SCOPE>` could be
    *  `LIB` - options applied during libraries build.
    *  `TEST` - options applied during test build.
    *  `BENCH` - options applied during benchmarks build.
    *  `COMMON` - options applied during all (libraries, test, benchmarks) builds.
*  `<STAGE>` could be
    *  `COMPILE` - options applied during the compilation.
    *  `LINK` - options applied during the linkage.
*  `<CATEGORY>` could be
    *  `FLAGS` - list of flags
    *  `LIBS` - list of libraries

*Examples*

Variable | Description
--- | ---
`TBB_COMMON_COMPILE_FLAGS` | Applied to libraries, tests and benchmarks as compile options
`TBB_LIB_LINK_FLAGS`       | Applied to libraries as link options
`TBB_LIB_LINK_LIBS `       | Applied to libraries as link libraries
`TBB_TEST_COMPILE_FLAGS`   | Applied to tests as compile options


#### Specific options

If the option used only in part of the places (library, tests, benchmarks) as well as adding this option to the group of other options is not possible,
then the option must be named using common sense.

Warnings supperssions should be added into `TBB_WARNING_SUPPRESS` variable which is applied during the compilation of libraries, tests and benchmarks.
Additional warnings should be added into `TBB_WARNING_TEST_FLAGS` variable which is applied during the compilation of tests.
